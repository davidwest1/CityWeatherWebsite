<h2>Lab Summary</h2>
Module 1: <br/>
I explored networking without having to purchase equipment or disrupt an existing network. I also simulated an office/enterprise network and visualized the topology of the network, as well as its physical components. There were several videos in this module that helped advance my networking knowledge and my skills using the features within Packet Tracer (ex. configuring devices using command line). <br/>
<br/>
Module 2: <br/>
I was able to build my own network in logical mode and visualize what it looks like from a topological perspective. I then configured the end devices and verified connectivity using physical mode, just as a networking professional would do in the field. <br/>
